# Welcome to the Bike Evaluator tracking and visualizing App
The main goal of this Project is that I can train some techniques from Spring Boot to a React Frontend.
I don't think this will be a big thing, but I try to build it fullstack.

## Introduction
In this App it is possible to save data about your bicycle movements, like driven kilometers, movement time, average
speed and maximum speed. The App will provide you with a table-view of your weekly, monthly or yearly movements with 
the overall Kilometers and the current Top values for average and maximum speed.<br>
It will also be possible to save your costs on parts and maintenance and calculate a costs per kilometer information.<br>
I will try to visualize some things in charts.

## Versions

### 0.0.1
In the first Version it will be possible to register a Bike, record driven kilometers and persist them in a database.

## Build

## Run
Currently it is recomended to run the application over IDE.<br>
In all cases you need to configure a PostgreSQL database first. (Description is coming soon)
